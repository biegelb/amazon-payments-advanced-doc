Installation
------------

**I have successfully installed Pay with Amazon extension, but when I try to go to the configuration page** :menuselection:`System --> Configuration --> Amazon Payments` **I am getting `404 Not Found` error.**

It's a Magento bug, the ACL list is not reloaded after the new extension is installed. To solve this issue please logout from the Magento admin and next login again.
