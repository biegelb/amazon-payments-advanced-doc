Overview
========

This extension provides an official integration of your Magento store with **Login and Pay with Amazon** services. They help your customers shop quickly, safely and securely. Your customers can pay on your website without re-entering their payment and address details. All Amazon transactions are protected by Amazon's A-to-z Guarantee.
